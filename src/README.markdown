These source files contain code to quickly evaluate the MÃ¶bius function,
generate datafiles for training, and helper scripts to actually run Int2Int.


## Quickstart ##

For the impatient, if you have `pytorch` and `Int2Int` installed as per
the [main README](../README.markdown), and want to use defaults, then you can
jump immediately into data generation and training via

    cd run_int2int_scripts/
    make run
